### Created by Jon, Sorrel, Chi 
## Our Vision
A Stardust Truce seeks to elevate student comprehension of core computer science concepts by providing an interactive utility that allows users to build common data structures from prefabricated code blocks.

Computer Science topics such as data structures can be difficult for even expert coders to   understand intuitively.
This can lead to unexpected bugs, inefficient code, and poor interview performance.

**TO DO** 
- Refactor element forms to give the user the feel of 'creating' a new element type
- Add more data structures possibilities
- Add moving images so students have better comprehensions of a data structure's methods, elements, and properties 
- Add drag and drop features to create a data structure with animation of elements corresponding to newly created fields
