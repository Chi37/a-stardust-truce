### Created by Jon, Sorrel, Chi 
## Our Vision
A Stardust Truce seeks to elevate student comprehension of core computer science concepts by providing an interactive utility that allows users to build common data structures from prefabricated code blocks.

Computer Science topics such as data structures can be difficult for even expert coders to   understand intuitively.
This can lead to unexpected bugs, inefficient code, and poor interview performance.

**TO DO** 
- Refactor element forms to give the user the feel of 'creating' a new element type
- Add more data structures possibilities
- Add moving images so students have better comprehensions of a data structure's methods, elements, and properties 
- Add drag and drop features to create a data structure with animation of elements corresponding to newly created fields


# Contribute Quick Start
1. [Clone the project] (https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/) cloning-a-repository
2. Create a feature branch (snake cased) with your initials at the front of the branch name 
	- `git checkout -b feature_branch_initial` (ex. ch_fix_navbar)
3. Add the original repo 
	- `git remote add upstream https://github.com/Chi37/a-stardust-truce`
3. Code, Do stuff!
4. Fetch upstream, Add and Commit Code
5. Push branch to your remote repo
6. Create a pull request on Github web page


Below is an image that shows our git workflow, we work on ONE particular issue and push it to the Dev branch to be reviewed and merged into master.
